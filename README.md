## What's the purpose?

 It's a mod made for Super Mario 64 PC Port. It remodels the whole game with DS models from Super Mario 64 DS! (**CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS!!!**)

## Instructions:
Firstly, you have to have the Render96 repo already cloned... (You can clone it from here: git clone https://github.com/Render96/Render96ex)

Or you can use Builder2 for git cloning it. (Download link for Builder2: https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/)

Then you should git clone https://github.com/ExcellentGamer/Super-Mario-64-DS-Remastered-Dev, is needed for installing the mod.

After you've done git cloning it, all you have to do is to copy everything from **Beta 1.1** folder and paste them into the subfolder of Render96.

Now time for compiling, all you have to do is to input `make -j4` in the terminal in order to compile. (For more information on compiling Super Mario 64 on PC, please visit https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port)

As for Builder2, all you need is to click on the **Compile** button so it can finally build the game.

## THE SIMPLE WAY! (ONLY AVAILABLE FOR CHARACTERS AND NOT FOR ALL MODELS!!!)
Drag and drop the folder **actors (Super-Mario-64-DS-Remastered-Dev\Patch\Beta 1.1\actors) (YOU SHOULD RENAME IT TOO!)** to your compiled build of Render96, it should be in Render96ex-alpha\build\us_pc\dynos\packs.

Go into the game, press Z and go to DynOS, Models Packs, and select the folder you've copied and pasted it.
Have fun!
