## THE SIMPLE WAY! (ONLY AVAILABLE FOR CHARACTERS AND NOT FOR ALL MODELS!!!)
Drag and drop everything inside **actors (Super-Mario-64-DS-Remastered-Dev\Patch\Beta 1.1\actors)** to your compiled build of Render96, it should be in Render96ex-alpha\build\us_pc\dynos\packs.

Go into the game, settings, Models, and select the folder you've copied and pasted it.
Have fun!
